## Overview
The code in this repository is used to generate the analysis presented in Patterson and Cardiff (2023), _Stiff, Smooth, and Solid?: Complex Fracture Hydraulics' Imprint on Oscillatory Flow Interference Testing_, a manuscript submitted to Water Resources Research for peer review. This paper describes a suite of numerical oscillatory hydraulic tomography (OHT) experiments to explore potential mechanisms contributing to an period-dependence in effective fracture hydraulic parameter estimates returned when characterizing bedrock fractures using oscillatory pressure signals. 

## models
This folder contains MATLAB scripts for each model used to simulate oscillatory flow tests and generate synthetic data used for parameter estimation. 
* fracture_heterogeneity.m: 2-D numerical groundwater flow model that explores the impact of aperture heterogeneity on effective fracture hydraulic parameter estimates
* validation_2d.m: This model verifies the accuracy of the above numerical model by comparing head phasors simulated by a homogeneous 2-D numerical model to head phasors simulated for a fully confined aquifer as described by Rasmussen et al. (2003)
* fracture_host_rock_fluid_exchange.m: 3-D numerical groundwater flow model that explores the impact of fluid exchange between the fracture and host rock on parameter estimates
* validation_3d.m: This model verifies the accuracy of the above numerical model by comparing head phasors simulated by a homogeneous 3-D numerical model to head phasors simulated for a leaky confined aquifer as described by Rasmussen et al. (2003)
* fracture_hydromechanics.mph: Axi-symmeteric COMSOL hydromechanical model that simulates pressure and fracture displacement signals and outputs the simulated data as .csv file, which serves as the input for hydromechanics_pest.m
* hydromechanics_pest.m: Uses COMSOL outputs to conduct effective fracture hydraulic parameter estimation
 
_All MATLAB scripts were developed using MATLAB 2019b and have recently been executed using MATLAB 2021b. Hydromechanical modeling was conducted using COMSOL 5.6_
